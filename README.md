# dsan-6600-final-project
Neural Networks &amp; Deep Learning


## Overview

The projects MUST use neural networks as a core component of the workflow.

The project MUST be a challenging problem, beyond what is done in the homework. It is okay to use the homework as a starting point but the project should take it to a significantly higher level.

The implementation must be in python.

You don't necessarily have to train the ANN from scratch (unless you need or want to). Instead, you could find a pre-trained model, such as YOLO, get it working, then use it as a tool to explore some larger problem. Then you could do some interesting data analytics to extract meaningful conclusions from the data obtained from the ANN.

The final lecture and lab time-slot will be dedicated to allowing the groups to present their solution of the group project.

Kaggle data and projects are allowed. In fact, you are more than welcome to try to compete in a currently active competition. However, the project must be a difficult one. For example, heavily studied educational competitions such as MNIST are not allowed.



## Deliverable components

Each group will be responsible for the following components:

*Code:* Provide an original solution to the problem (hosted on Github). Private repositories are allowed, however, if the repo is private, you must make a professor a collaborator before the end of the semester, that way we can see the code.

*Summary write-up:* Provide a concise 4 to 6 page summary document about what you did

*Slides and presentation:* Present your goals, methods, and results in a 15 minute presentation at the end of the semester
You will also each be required to do a peer-evaluation document for each of your team-mates (link will be provided later)


## Submission and due dates

- Upload the following to Canvas before the start of the section in which your group is presenting during the last week of class - URL to the GitHub repo hosting the project code:
   - PDF of the 4 to 6 page summary document 
   - PDF of slides - Peer review evaluation (link will be provided later in the semester). All students must complete this for each group member.
